#### **Description**

The final project should essentially look like any of our small projects, but with two key differences:

1. You will decide on the data set to use, and I especially encourage you to _find and/or use a data set that is related to your thesis topic._ If this is not possible, I can help you find a data set on a topic relevant to your interests. Please get in contact as soon as possible if you need help finding data.

2. You must create a digital poster similar to what you might use at an academic conference, that presents your project visually.

#### **Evaluation**

To receive full credit, I am looking for:

- Clear, coherent questions about the data.

- Some form of data import / reading data into R.

- Data tidying with the use of at least 5 `dplyr` or `tidyr` verbs. The data manipulations should be purposeful---they should be used to get the data into shape for answering your questions and plotting.

- At least 3 well-designed plots that address your questions.

- Interpretation of your plots and responses to your proposed questions.

- Appropriate visual presentation of your work in a poster format.

- As in the small projects, you will be graded on workflow and presentation rather than on the particular conclusions, and statistical analysis is not necessary.

#### **What to turn in**

- The raw data set used in the analysis (contact me if there are any concerns about this).

- An RMarkdown report in `HTML` format with **all R code used**, at least 3 plots, and a written narrative of approximately 1000 words.

- The `.Rmd` file used to make the report.

- The digital poster (in a format such as `PDF`---no actual printed posters please!).
