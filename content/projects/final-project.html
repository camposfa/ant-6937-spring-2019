<h4><strong>Description</strong></h4>
<p>The final project should essentially look like any of our small projects, but with two key differences:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>You will decide on the data set to use, and I especially encourage you to <em>find and/or use a data set that is related to your thesis topic.</em> If this is not possible, I can help you find a data set on a topic relevant to your interests. Please get in contact as soon as possible if you need help finding data.</p></li>
<li><p>You must create a digital poster similar to what you might use at an academic conference, that presents your project visually.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="evaluation" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Evaluation</strong></h4>
<p>To receive full credit, I am looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clear, coherent questions about the data.</p></li>
<li><p>Some form of data import / reading data into R.</p></li>
<li><p>Data tidying with the use of at least 5 <code>dplyr</code> or <code>tidyr</code> verbs. The data manipulations should be purposeful—they should be used to get the data into shape for answering your questions and plotting.</p></li>
<li><p>At least 3 well-designed plots that address your questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Interpretation of your plots and responses to your proposed questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Appropriate visual presentation of your work in a poster format.</p></li>
<li><p>As in the small projects, you will be graded on workflow and presentation rather than on the particular conclusions, and statistical analysis is not necessary.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-to-turn-in" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>What to turn in</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><p>The raw data set used in the analysis (contact me if there are any concerns about this).</p></li>
<li><p>An RMarkdown report in <code>HTML</code> format with <strong>all R code used</strong>, at least 3 plots, and a written narrative of approximately 1000 words.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>.Rmd</code> file used to make the report.</p></li>
<li><p>The digital poster (in a format such as <code>PDF</code>—no actual printed posters please!).</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
