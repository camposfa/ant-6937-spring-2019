<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this small project, you will again think of conceptual questions to ask of one or more data sets.</p>
<p><strong>There are various options for the data sets.</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>You can use one or more of the data sets listed below.</p></li>
<li><p>You can bring your own data set, but if you choose this option, bear in mind that your final project asks you to find a data set related to your theis or interests, and any plots you make for this small project should not be duplicated in the final project.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>All your questions can be from one data set, or you can ask different questions of different data sets. It’s up to you. Please see the detailed descriptions of the example data set at the bottom of the page.</p>

<div id="instructions" class="section level2">
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p><strong>Content Instructions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Think of three (and only three!) conceptual questions about any of the data sets. Clearly state each question in your report. You might want to create different sections for your different questions.</li>
<li>Using <code>dplyr</code> and/or <code>tidyr</code>, manipulate the data as necessary to get it into shape for plotting.</li>
<li>Using <code>ggplot2</code>, create <em>at least one plot for each question</em> that helps you to answer the question. For each plot, provide an explanation for why you chose the <em>type</em> of plot (e.g. scatterplot, boxplot, bar chart, histogram, etc.), and why you believe that it is best for showing the information related to your question.</li>
<li>Answer your questions by interpreting your plots and identifying any trends that they reveal (or do not reveal).</li>
<li>In total, your text related to the conceptual questions, plot design decisions, and interpretation should be in the neighborhood of 1000 words.</li>
<li>In your report,
<ul>
<li><strong>Use at least 3 different <code>dplyr</code> verbs</strong> (e.g., <code>filter()</code>, <code>arrange()</code>, <code>select()</code>, <code>mutate()</code>, <code>summarise()</code>, <code>group_by()</code>, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Use at least 1 <code>tidyr</code> verb</strong> (e.g., <code>pivot_longer()</code>, <code>pivot_wider()</code>, or the older versions if necessary).</li>
<li><strong>Use at least 3 different <code>ggplot2</code> geoms.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Formatting Instructions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The project report should look similar to some of our class activities, but it should include more narrative/explanation along with the code and plots.</li>
<li>Please create your report in an R markdown file called <code>small-project-2_XX.Rmd</code>, where you substitute your initials for “XX” (for example, my report would be called <code>small-project-2_FC.Rmd</code>.</li>
<li>The R Markdown report should show all of the code that you used to work with the data and produce your plots.</li>
<li>Put your <code>.html</code> file and the <code>.Rmd</code> file <strong>together in one <code>.zip</code> file and submit through Blackboard.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Evaluation Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Projects will be graded on workflow and presentation rather than particular conclusions. <em>So don’t fret if you ask a question that fails to turn up interesting results!</em> The data are what they are.</p>
<p>To receive full credit, I am looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear, coherent questions about the data. Questions end in a question mark!</li>
<li>The data manipulations should be purposeful—they should be used to get the data into shape for answering your questions and plotting.</li>
<li>Each plot that you include in the report should help to answer one of your proposed questions, with a justification for <em>why</em> you chose to make the type of plot that you made. I am not looking for a dumping ground of many preliminary or poor-quality plots that you experimented with while trying to make a good one.</li>
<li>Interpretation of your plots and responses to your proposed question.</li>
</ul>
