title: "Small Project 1: Redesigning bad figures"

---

Projects should essentially look like any of our modules, but with you identifying the dataset and questions rather than working from a template. You may choose to replicate a figure from an existing study, but are also encouraged to use this opportunity to perform some exploratory analysis on data you may be using in your DS421 team projects or your own dissertation research.  Remember that as with modules, finals will be graded on workflow and presentation rather than particular conclusions.  Statistical analysis is not necessary, but any project should demonstrate a suite of skills selected from the list in the final project rubric.  



## Proposals

Data analysis: For each task, write down an interpretation of your visualization (and what it reveals about the data) in 1-2 sentences max.

* Task 1: Pick two numerical variables and use a scatterplot to visualize their relationship.
* Task 2: Pick a third categorical variable, and color the points on the scatterplot by levels of this variable.
* Task 3: Pick two categorical variables and make a bar plot that depicts the relationship between them.
* Task 4: Pick a numerical and a categorical variable, and construct side-by-side box plots depicting the relationship between them.
* Task 5: Learn something new: violin plots! Read about them at http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_violin.html, and convert your side-by-side box plots from the previous task to violin plots.



Please create your proposal in a markdown file called `proposal.md` in the root directory of the final project repo.  


## Preliminary Rubric (additional areas will be added)

### Project questions must illustrate all of the following tasks:

- Some form of data access / reading into R
- Data tidying preparation
- Initial data visualization
- Use of GitHub
- Reproducible execution with use of Travis
- RMarkdown writeup, with final submission as a nicely formatted PDF document that includes code and results.
- Overall clean and clear presentation of repository, code, and explanations.

### and at least three of the following skills (this list may be modified/extended):

- Use of at least 5 `dplyr` verbs / functions
- Writing / working with custom R functions
- Creating an R package for functions used in the analysis
- Interaction with an API
- Use of regular expressions
- Use of an external relational database
- Preparing processed data for archiving / publication
- Parsing extensible data formats (JSON, XML)
- Use of spatial vector data (`sf` package) and visualization of spatial data
- Creation of an R package
- Use of `purrr` package functions for [iteration](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html)
- Manipulation of [dates](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html) or [strings](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html)
- Unique challenges you encounter: particularly messy data/ non-standard formats, special emphasis on visualization or presentation of results.
