## Overview

This course is designed for graduate students in social or natural sciences who would like to gain experience in data visualization and analysis using R. It aims to be accessible to those who are completely new to programming, but also to provide new insights and skills to those who already have experience using R.

## Approach

This course will use a mix of traditional and  [flipped classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) approaches, with new material introduced in reading assignments prior to class while class time will focus on applying those skills to data sets. The course will be activity-focused. Most concepts will be first introduced in assigned readings outside of class, leaving class time to focus on developing practical skills, completing activities, making progress on individual projects. We will cover topics in both data visualization as well as data manipulation. 
Students are encouraged to work collaboratively in and out of class. The [online course schedule](/schedule/) provides an overview of the topics covered as well as links
to weekly readings, in-class activities, and any lecture material.  This schedule
is preliminary and always subject to change.

## Texts

We will read sections from four openly licensed, online textbooks for this course. Hard copies of the books are *not* required, but some can be found at the links below.
