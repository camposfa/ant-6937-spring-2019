## Overview

This course is designed for graduate students who would like to gain experience in data visualization and analysis using R, regardless of prior experience. It aims to be accessible to those who are completely new to programming, but also to provide new insights and skills to those who already have experience using R.

## Approach

This course will use a [flipped classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) approach, with new material introduced in reading assignments prior to class while class time will focus on applying these skills to data sets. The course will be activity- and project-focused. Most concepts will be first introduced in assigned readings outside of class, leaving class time to focus on developing practical skills, completing activities, and creating plots. We will move through modules that focus on data visualization as well as data manipulation. Students will be expected to work collaboratively in and out of class. The [course syllabus](/syllabus/)
provides an overview of the topics covered as well as links
to weekly readings, in-class activities, and any lecture material.  This syllabus
is preliminary and always subject to change.

## Texts

We will read sections from four openly licensed, online textbooks for this course. Hard copies of the books are *not* required, but some can be found at the links below.
