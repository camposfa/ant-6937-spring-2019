## Overview

This course is designed for upper division undergraduate students regardless of prior experience. We aim to be accessible to those new to programming, but those who have been using R for years will find new material in this opinionated and fast moving area.  The course is project focused and centered around five [modules](/modules) reproducing important results in global change ecology.  A series of short [tutorials](/tutorials) will introduce relevant technology, but most concepts will be first introduced in reading outside of class, leaving class time to focus on the more complex examples encountered in the modules.  

## Approach

This course will use a [flipped classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) model, with new material
introduced in reading assignments prior to class while class time will
focus on applying these skills to explore interesting data sets. We
will move though four modules, each introducing a new data set and
new scientific questions, while also introducing a new skill area and 
building on previous skills. Students will be expected to work collaboratively
in and out of class, and course content and grading will emphasize
communication and reproducibility of an analysis as much as scientific
or technical completeness.  The [Course Syllabus](/syllabus/)
provides an overview of the modules and topics covered as well as links
to weekly reading, assignments, and any lecture material.  This syllabus
is preliminary and always subject to change.

## Texts

We will use [Grolemund and Wickham's *R For Data Science*](http://amzn.to/2aHLAQ1) 
as the primary text for this course. A hard copy of the book is not
required and the openly licensed full text can be found on the [author's website for this book](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). Additional reading material will be linked
from the syllabus.  Please be sure to review the relevant reading prior to
each class session.
