## Course Description

This course introduces theory and practical skills for managing and displaying quantitative information so that visual stories can be found and communicated effectively. We will cover principles of tidy data, strategies for data exploration, and principles of visual presentation. We will use the R computing environment, but no prior programming experience is required. The emphasis is on gaining practical skills that will empower students to answer questions with data.


## Course Goals

This course will provide students an opportunity to master theoretical concepts in data visualization and to acquire valuable skills for exploring data and producing statistical graphics. Students will learn how to use R to produce visualizations and work with quantitative data, and to apply these skills to communicate scientific knowledge effectively.


## Student Learning Objectives/Outcomes

During this semester, students will have the opportunity to: 
- Learn fundamental principles and best practices for the visual display of quantitative data.
- Become familiar with data input, analysis, and export using the R statistical computing environment.
- Achieve proficiency with key R packages for data visualization and exploration.
- Develop skills in written and oral communication and graphical display of data through online activities, small group assignments, and individual projects.


## Course Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for this class. In particular, prior programming experience is not required. Some familiarity with quantitative methods and data analysis would be helpful. Students with significant experience in R should still find new things to learn or important knowledge to review in each lesson.


## Course Materials

All reading materials will be online or posted to the course website. Assigned readings should be completed **before** the start of class on the day indicated.

## Course Requirements

#### <u>In-Class Exercises</u>
As a (mostly) flipped classroom, our in-class time will involve brief refreshers on new concepts introduced in the readings followed by working on exercises that relate to those concepts. These exercises will include DataCamp chapters or courses that can be accessed through the course's [DataCamp portal](../datacamp/), as well as custom activities that the instructor will describe in class. While students are working on these exercises, the instructor will actively engage with students to help them understand material that they find confusing, help identify problems that are preventing students from completing the exercises, and discuss novel applications and alternative approaches to the data visualization challenges that students are working to complete.

**Assigned in-class exercises can be found under the "Assignments" column of the [course schedule](../schedule/).**

<br>

#### <u>Small Projects</u>

During the term, there will be two small data visualization projects that each student must complete. The professor will provide a data set and detailed instructions for each project. In brief, the projects will be visualization challenges in which the student will read in the data set in R, produce one or more visualizations of the data, and provide a written narrative (~1000 words) of interesting aspects or insights gained in the process of analyzing the data. The submission should be an RMarkdown report in `HTML` format, and it must include the `R` code used, the embedded visualizations, and the written narrative. Please also submit the `.Rmd` file used to make the report.

<br>

#### <u>Final Project</u>

For the final project, students are encouraged to use a data set of their own related to their thesis topic, if possible. If this is not possible, the professor can help to find a data set on a topic relevant to the student’s interests. The submitted final project should include:

- The raw data set used in the analysis (contact me if there are any concerns about this).
- An RMarkdown report in `HTML` format with all `R` code used, at least 3 plots, and a written narrative of approximately 1000 words. 
- The `.Rmd` file used to make the report.
- A digital poster (in `PDF` format—no actual printed posters please!), similar to what you might present at an academic conference, that presents your project visually.

<br>

#### <u>Attendance and Participation</u>

Regular attendance will be essential to the successful completion of this course. Attendance is mandatory and will count toward your final grade. We are aiming for a supportive and cooperative learning environment. To accomplish this, I expect students to be actively engaged participants in all classroom activities.

Details of grading scheme can be found in the course syllabus posted to Blackboard. Grades will be assigned using the following weighted components:

{.table .table-striped}

Component      | Weight   
---------------|-----
Completion of In-class Exercises   | 40% 
First Small Project  | 15%
Second Small Project | 15%
Final Project  | 25%
Attendance and Participation | 5%


## Make-up policy

Late assignments will be penalized 20% and will not be accepted more than 48 hours late except in cases of genuine emergencies that can be documented by the student or in cases where late submission has been discussed and approved in advance.

## Cooperative Learning Environment

I encourage you to discuss the course activities with your friends and classmates as you are working on them. You will learn more in this class if you work with others than if you do not. 

However, **you should not directly copy code or allow other students to copy your code.** When cooperating on a problem, you can and should discuss it with others, but write your own solutions. Direct copying of code will be considered cheating, and will be subject to the Scholastic Dishonesty policies outlined in the Student Code of Conduct.

Share ideas, ask questions, ask for help, but don't copy.


## Code of Conduct

- _Classroom Etiquette:_ I expect and require behavior compatible with a high standard of scholarship. Refrain from distracting behavior, such as talking during lectures, and wait until class is dismissed before packing up your belongings. Please try not to arrive late or leave early. Most importantly, you must show respect for each other’s opinions and differing levels of prior knowledge and ability.

- _Scholastic Dishonesty:_ Students must adhere to the standards of academic honesty in the [Student Code of Conduct](http://catalog.utsa.edu/informationbulletin/appendices/studentcodeofconduct/). These policies will be strictly enforced, and violations may result in severe consequences, including failing the course and dismissal from the university. According to the Code of Conduct: 
>"Scholastic Dishonesty or academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, collusion, falsifying academic records, and any act designed to give unfair advantage to the student (such as, but not limited to, submission of essentially the same written assignment for two (2) courses without the prior permission of the instructor, providing false or misleading information in an effort to receive a postponement or an extension on a test, quiz, or other assignment), or the attempt to commit such an act.”
