Chapters 1--4 of **[Data Visualization with ggplot2 (Part 1)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-visualization-with-ggplot2-1)** by Rick Scavetta.

- Chapter 1: "Introduction"
- Chapter 2: "Data"

- Chapter 4: "Geometries"

If you get stuck, feel free to [email](mailto:fernando.campos@utsa.edu) me or come by my office for some guidance.

**Do not bother with Chapter 5: "qplot and wrapup".**  
The `qplot()` function is a bare-bones and much less useful version of the `ggplot()` function. I recommend never to use it.
