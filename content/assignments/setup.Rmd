## Complete in Class


To start becoming familiar with R, we're going to complete some interactive, self-paced lessons using [swirl](https://swirlstats.com/).

<br><hr>

**Steps:**

<br>

1. Open up RStudio, type the following in the console pane (next to the `>` symbol), and press Enter. This should install the 'swirl' package for R. That means the package files have been downloaded and saved to your computer. 

```
install.packages("swirl")
```

<br>

2. But to actually use the functions in the swirl package, we need to **load** the package into our current R session. We do this using the `library()` function, providing it the name of the package that we want to load.

```
library("swirl")
```

<br>

3. Enter the following command to install a very basic course called "R_Programming_E" (admittedly, not the greatest name).

```
install_course_github("swirldev", "R_Programming_E")
```

<br>

4. Okay! We're ready to run the course. Enter the following:

```
swirl()
```

<br>

5. When prompted (after a few screens), choose the lesson called "**Basic Building Blocks**".
