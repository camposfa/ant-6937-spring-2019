#### `ggplot2` resources

- [Quick-reference `ggplot2` cheatsheet](/files/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)

- [Comprehensive documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html)

- [A book with more detail than you'll ever need](https://ggplot2-book.org/index.html)

- Don't bother with the `qplot()` function. It's a bare-bones, training wheels version of the `ggplot()` function that provides fewer options. It's much less useful and not much easier to use, so I recommend never to use it.
