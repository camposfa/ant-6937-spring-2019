title: Reshaping Data
---

<br><br>

To complete this week's activities, you will need to install the "development" version of `tidyr`.

```
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/tidyr")
```

#### **Important note:**

As we discussed in class on March 21, the wide/long reshaping functions were in flux when we learned about them. Since that time, the authors have settled on slightly different names: `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`. It looks like these names are going to stick. All course materials have been updated accordingly. You will not see this change unless you reinstall the development version of `tidyr` by (re-)running the command `devtools::install_github("tidyverse/tidyr")`.
