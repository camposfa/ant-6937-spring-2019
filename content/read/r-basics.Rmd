## Read

- [**ModernDive Ch. 1: Getting Started with Data in R**](https://moderndive.com/1-getting-started.html) (section 1.1 is review, the rest may be more useful)

- [**Healy Section 2.3: Things to know about R**](https://socviz.co/gettingstarted.html#things-to-know-about-r)

- [**Chapter 2 of R Markdown: The Definitive Guide**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/basics.html) (skip the long video at the end and the example applications)


## Skim

- [**Tidyverse style guide, Ch. 1 and Ch. 2**](http://style.tidyverse.org/).  Consistent style is an important element of communication and collaboration. **SKIM** over the sections **[1. Files](https://style.tidyverse.org/files.html)** and **[2. Syntax](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html)**. *Don't worry if you don't understand the code examples.* Just try to get a feel for the style recommendations (e.g., using meaningful names for R objects, indenting, use of spacing, parentheses, commas, etc.)
