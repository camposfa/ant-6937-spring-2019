title: "Background on Fish Collapse Data"
---

The material for this session is a little different, aiming at background on the scientific issues rather than background on the method. Do take a moment to look over the papers and short documentary.  Do also review the previous references to make sure you are comfortable with `group_by()` and `summarize()` patterns.
