title: "Iterate using purrr"

## Watch

**[Chapters 3 & 4 of Writing Functions in R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/writing-functions-in-r)**. Theste two chapters are focused on `purrr` and it's use in iteration, particulaly the `map()` family.  It may seem surprising that these tools for *iteration* are buried in the second half of a course on *writing functions*, but as you will see, these concepts are closely linked through a style known as functional programming, which is particularly relevant to much data science type analyses.
