## Read

- **[R4DS, 5.6--5.7: Data Transformation](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#grouped-summaries-with-summarise):** `dplyr` basic verbs: `summarise`, `group_by`, and new ways to use `mutate` and `filter`.


<br><br>

## Optional further reading (_same as last week_).

- **[Introduction to dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html):** many code examples
- **[Modern Dive, Chapter 4: Data Wrangling](https://moderndive.com/4-wrangling.html):** Similar to assigned reading but organized differently. Might be a little easier to follow?
