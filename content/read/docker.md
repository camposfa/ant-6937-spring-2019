- [Install Docker (Community Edition, free & open source) for your laptop](https://store.docker.com/search?offering=community&type=edition). (Mac, Windows, & Linux)

- Launch the Docker command line, and run: `docker pull rocker/tidyverse` to download the image we'll be using in class.  This is a large download (689 MB), so please attempt this ahead of time since we won't all be able to download it at once.  If either of these steps do not work for you, don't worry, we should be able to fix any special cases in class.  


## Debugging Docker Install

### MacOS

Docker installation is pretty robust on MacOS now.  Very old Mac systems may need to use [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/) instead.

### Windows

Windows support has been evolving rapidly. If Docker Community Edition installation fails, try installing [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/) instead. This adds another virtual layer, but is also better tested on a wide range of Windows machines.  

### Linux

See <https://docs.docker.com/install/>.  Docker is included in most package manangers as well. 

## If all else fails...

No worries, you will still be able to install and run Docker on a cloud platform through your web browser.  With cloud computing, you'll never need to install anything locally anyway.  We will cover this in class.
