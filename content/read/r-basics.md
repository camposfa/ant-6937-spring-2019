- **[Tidyverse style guide, Ch. 1 and Ch. 2](http://style.tidyverse.org/)**.  Consistent style is an important element of communication and collaboration. **Skim** over the sections **[1. Files](https://style.tidyverse.org/files.html)** and **[2. Syntax](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html)**. *Don't worry if you don't understand the code examples.* Just try to get a feel for the style recommendations (e.g., using meaningful names for R objects, indenting, use of spacing, parentheses, commas, etc.)
