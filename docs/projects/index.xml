  You will decide on the data set to use, and I especially encourage you to find and/or use a data set that is related to your thesis topic. If this is not possible, I can help you find a data set on a topic relevant to your interests.</description>

      <description>Due date: Apr. 18 by the end of the day (11:59:59 pm)Introduction In this small project, you will think of conceptual questions to ask of one or more data sets.
Because I think some of you disliked the ape_teeth data set from small project 1, this time I&amp;rsquo;m providing several different data sets that can be used.
All your questions can be from one data set, or you can ask different questions of different data sets.</description>
